Was literally running up and down the wing, delivering crosses (tougher than squaring a ball in the box) defending and what not. I think you are affected by the recency bias."

There is a video with plays by Messi, CR7, Zidane, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Maradona, and the same plays had already been done by Pele. Fun fact: Pele went to be a keeper in two games and even defended a penalty kick."
