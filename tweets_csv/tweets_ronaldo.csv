837,@_Abyy__ It’s funny he mentions Ronaldo cos he was still v good at 36 (older than Messi) acting like he didn’t have crazy longevity is ridiculous
838,@BarcaWorldwide At the end of the day calling someone the greatest comes down to opinion and perspective. Ronaldo will have his fans and so will Messi. Why do people get offended when someone calls the opposite the greatest? This is a pointless argument.
839,@Opresii Unless Mbappe converts to a striker which he is against. Age will catch him and he cannot continue depending on pace alone. Remember Ronaldo was in the same shoe and he converted and became a tap in merchant. Even with Messi right now he walks in games
840,@ESPNFC @Hamidwakawa Can ronaldo ever?

1198,@_berryllium_ @kofoworola__a So Ronaldo's dive against Ghana is not soft ??? ...... You people only talk when it doesn't favour you. VAR checks every decision that leads or can lead to a goal. They will only show us if it's controversial and they want the Ref to decide.
1199,Portugal will win 2026 world cup in USA and I hope @Cristiano 🐐 will play he's a strong player. Come back after 4 yrs n check this tweet

3154,Wish Ronaldo can tell her sister to sh*t the f*ck up sometimes.. She invites more slander for him every time she opens her mouth
3155,"@dollypiper_7 @brfootball For me Messi is the goat simply because he makes his team better, when Ronaldo doesn’t get service he is ineffective when Messi doesn’t get the service he provides it. And that for me makes him a better play. It’s as simple as that."

3172,"@Thfcmm__ @dilasq Imo Mbappe will reach that Top 10 all time level. Maybe/possibly also top5. But I don't see anyone reaching what Messi and even Ronaldo did in longevity.

2) It established Mbappe as the next best player in the world
3) It ended Cristiano Ronaldo’s competitive career (professional and international)"
3202,@tichaonabee @DarkForceGirl01 Guys soccer evolved &amp; these Pele &amp; Maradona played well in their era. I want to reiterate that Messi &amp; Ronaldo played in a much more competitive era - where soccer has been commercialised with well drilled opponents. These 2 are the best for me!
3203,"@EbenezarWikina Mbappe is already at a disadvantage. By the time Messi was 23, he'd already won 3 Ballon d'Ors. By the time Ronaldo was 23, he'd won 1. Mbappe hasn't won any, and he's clocking 24."

3227,@MrTwoFooted @HenryJackson87 @RollsonShabbos The very best of Ronaldo managed to win 3 ucls in a row being the best player in every campaign while plahing in a team of 10 players he made worse? He must’ve been quite good to do that. The very best of MSN only won 1 and neither messi or Suarez were t2 in that campaign 🤡
3228,@Abuloted @UTDTrey Talk about Ronaldo then 😂
3229,"@CalebAP12 that’s mine as of now, assuming that’s Cristiano. the T2 have much better individual stats so the WC’s from the latter 3 don’t trump it.

however, Messi’s WC trumps Ronaldo’s because even tho he has the individual trophies, he doesn’t have that grand prize."

most g/a
most assists
7 ballon dors
and now with world cup he has won every major trophy there is 
(he also has a better goal to game ratio than ronaldo who has the most goals of all time)

and thats not all"
3245,"@Evertxn Because the greatest of all time status involves the players whole career and if we’re being honest, ronaldo hasn’t done anything of note since 2018 and will most likely never play in CL again"

4141,@MiIton47 Nah honestly was very close to putting R9 over CR7. On R9s day I will take him over CR7 but can’t fault the longevity. I think R9 is better than Ronaldo as a player but over a career cr7 speaks for itself unfortunately

4244,@MadridPreeti 😆 cry me a river. You guy blame everyone except your Ronaldo that lost form. https://t.co/AV0674PDAU

4290,"@IrokoPedepo Yeah not a lie, but the Norway comparison? Come on. At no point were they that bad. I'm not even an Argentina fan but before 2010, Argentina was in a much worse place than Portugal. Ronaldo in 06 came into a team with some of the best in the world at the time."
4291,"@biglittleflyer @SubhajitDey7 @CristianoXtra_ Whereas Ronaldo didn't to an extent.

4971,Damn he’s 119 million away from the 🐐 of instagram @Cristiano
4972,"@Twizzinn @w_onyango @KMbappe Messi doesn't compare to anyone, with Cristiano Ronaldo admitting that. This is the truth and the debate is over https://t.co/b6q6FOpMNF"
4973,"Cristiano “No World Cup” Ronaldo 😭

That’s his new name😭"
4974,@Nick85195684 @FarianTauhid @Carra23 @carra Yeah of course Cara wouldn’t have said ronaldo is the goat if he won the World Cup because he isn’t. All this World Cup has done is confirmed it to neutrals. Anyone who understands football has known that messi is the host for a long time
4975,@AC4ROLEV2 year and a half ago? I repped ronaldo pre 2018 'sajan'
4976,"@ESPNUK 1. Pele 2.Messi 3.Maradona , however pele didn’t have the current conditions of strong European teams and competitors as messi and Ronaldo had."
4977,@nba_toao @AnkurMessi_ Won't be surprised if Ronaldo stabs his entire household and the news comes out this week
4978,@Agyeiwaa__1 Yes we will still Ronaldo ✊🏽
4979,"15 years going and Ronaldo fans still don't get it. Messi could win the Ballon D'or, not because of the goals he scored. It was the magical things he was doing when he wasn't scoring."
4980,"This literally has to be a joke. 

When Ronaldo won the Euro’s all you heard was how he did it on the big stage. 

If we are to compare international career… 

Messi winning the World Cup with that Argentina squad and Portugal/Ronaldo failing to win it with a better squad…"
4981,"@Joshua_Ubeku @MrAncelotti Hey bro, don’t forget that Garnacho an Argentinian footballer hasn’t said anything because he idolizes Ronaldo. He didn’t even congratulate Argentina. Cringe"
4982,@Musawen23385439 @SxnchoHive @TeamCRonaldo Portugal were not struggling shit before ronaldo. They were ranked 4th in 2006 world cup when Cr7 was still a boy
4983,"mbappe is better than ronaldo was at 23, but he won’t have a better career no"
4984,@Debbybruno3 Ronaldo all time GOAT
4985,"Recency bias.
Bold of you to exclude Cristiano Ronaldo.
F'king Weirdos"
4986,@TeamCRonaldo Imagine being so angry you tried to justify it. Ronaldo couldn’t even start for Portugal in the end
4987,"@UgwunnaEjikem Funny how you even assume Ronaldo was ever in a G.O.A.T debate. They are talking about Messi, Madonna and Pele,  dude lol."
4988,@Cristiano @zujugp The king https://t.co/oYsGsY7acs
4989,"i knew the ronaldo i fell in love it , made me love football 
nothings stopping that , i’m sorry"
4990,@PortugalTaIk @Relish_Juniper ur so shameless man change ur name to “All things ronaldo”
4991,Pls let club football just start the World Cup has been an amazing tournament but just tired of Ronaldo FC crying too much honestly...
4992,@H_Permza Ronaldo is nore than a World Cup achiever... BENZEMA has a world cup medal btw
4993,@notsamir1308 @blickyx_ @TeamCRonaldo And Ronaldo didn't at Euro 2016??
4994,"@Big_Ochuko @Pokerface7__ @FIFAWorldCup @Argentina @Budweiser @budfootball That's not true😂 did they get a penalty against Australia and Mexico ?

Anyway Messi is a world cup winner and best player of the tournament, while Ronaldo was flop of the tournament and unemployed"
4995,@CrusaderSdm @90sfootball Ronaldo didn't play in 94 stop claiming world cups
4996,"@brian___jethro I can't stop laughing, how some people are jealous. Why did Ronaldo earn the nickname Penaldo?"
4997,@WoobaccRainy @frayhnk Ronaldo gets cash his new contract is 500 mil.
4998,"@bugi986 @7777Goatnaldo @ESPNUK In order to get a penalty one must advance to the opposition's box with the ball, and Portugal, Ronaldo in specific, is not very good at that

Bruno had a chance and he dived before any point of contact was established, loser mentality prevented them from advancing"
4999,"Messi's Instagram post after winning the World Cup  received more than 46 million likes in 18 hours.

That makes it the most-liked photo by any athlete in Instagram history, passing Cristiano Ronaldo's previous record of 42 million.
