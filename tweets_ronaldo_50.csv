7,@cange_james @ShanksRo @bresap13 @Feunekz @_common_W_ Ask the person who made the initial tweet. It's both Mbappé n Messi that ended the world cup not Messi n Ronaldo.
8,@NanaKof78032977 @Cristiano inspiring una? someone is playing his football and building legacy for himself but mose he’s doing it for Ronaldo. I know your love for these young boys will turn to hate when they start comparing them to your cr7 and I will be waiting for that day waahh.
9,@SAMJAY463 @europefootb @kemz_mama @Anambrapunter @metuchizzy @piersmorgan @38 See ehn if you want to mention leagues in Europe regarding Messi stop mentioning EPL. Man  conquered that league without even playing there 😂😂. He has more goals against top 6 epl teams than Ronaldo wey spend pass 4 szsn for there. Plus he's winning another bdor outside Barca
10,@daiyalnaa Messi is Kylian’s idol with Ronaldo💀

12,Cristiano Ronaldo is named in the WORST team of the World Cup in Qatar https://t.co/axKZ0YsiLs
13,"@laligafrauds It's better if you stop now and avoid further embarrassment. Messi fans have already moved on, Ronaldo isn't even relevant anymore, the debate ended long back and the WC was nail in the coffin.

""The egg"" is more relevant now than Ronaldo."
14,"@ESPNUK 1.Ronaldo 
2. Maradona
3.pele 
4.Messi
That's what I think and feel😣"
15,"@fayzzzzzinho @totalcristiano @Altin30i most insecure fanbase lmaoooo

Ronaldo is the goat, keep crying"
16,@TeamCRonaldo People forgetting a 37 year old Ronaldo outscored Messi last season whilst playing for a failing Man United team in the toughest league in the world. Meanwhile Messi couldnt score for the best team in a farmers league. Pick who you want I don't care but theyve both been great 1/2
17,@donrosc @bilalcov98 @SandhuMMA I will never understand how people take comments about Messi vs Ronaldo so personally hahaha. Like those guys are millionaires and who don’t even know you exist. But thanks for backing me
18,@FCBarcelona @FIFAWorldCup Ronaldo better. Who cares... and ronaldo doesn't need a wc to prove himself as the goat he is already one.
19,@__georginagio Ronaldo is still my goat 🐐 and nothing can change that

29,@apb40 @Cristiano Exacto!
30,@boychild_cookie @bresap13 @CryptoTroll10 @Feunekz @_common_W_ Ronaldo living rent free in your head lmao not even about him
31,@piersmorgan Goodness me @piersmorgan concentrate on your own life because the strange obsession with ronaldo and constantly having something negative to say about harry and meghan shows that you really are a sad little man
32,"@Lytswtf nope Messi = Curry 
Ronaldo = Kyrie/Lebron/KD
Mbappe = Luka/Ja/Giannis or Devin Booker"
33,"The Messi and Ronaldo debate was always based on clout, not football."
34,"@3YearLetterman @TeamMessi @Cristiano @AaronDonald97 @atrupar @EricPickles @UKHouseofLords @WaffleHouse @mikepiazza31 @MileyCyrus @billyraycyrus Fact:
Never has a Not Football League team qualified for the World Cup."
35,"Thats why Ronaldo is the 🐐 
Its not only bc of being the best player but also bc of his personality. Ronaldo speaks his mind, tells the truth, is a very kind and thoughtful person. #CristianoRonaldo"
36,"I'm happy Messi won the WC, would have e preferred Ronaldo but one of them had to win it for the story of both of their careers, just a shame they act like this towards Ronaldo"
37,"@juicy_rep @J15SV @MacBreandan @henrywinter Ronaldo did it tho, moved when Man U was dominant, same with Madrid and Juve so tf u talking about"

39,@piersmorgan And France's first penalty was a penalty. Lighter than dimaria tackle. You have really lost the plot. Stop fame whoring using Ronaldo..leave that guy alone as well..you will take.him.down
40,@iUsedToBeADuck Watch top goals by Cristiano Ronaldo
41,"@Nerdz1997 @doronklemer @india97sm @AllySmith111 @andy_murray @FIFAWorldCup @piersmorgan Bro take a rest, messi vs ronaldo is over, its messi vs the egg now, leave the conversation my friend"

47,"@Zeko_Penguin @HULKANATOR619 @EliasAbti @Masi_9000 @UTDTraviss @CFCRaf2 @18 Shut up. He won two international trophy's before your short man devil. Lmao 🤣.
Besides world isn't designed to be won by everyone. 

Argentina win this twice before. Portugal hardly qualify for it before Ronaldo. It brought them up to the light. He's literally the goat 🐐"
48,@JasonAU1981 @hockey_dad74 @RichieR77444720 @3YearLetterman @TeamMessi @Cristiano @AaronDonald97 @atrupar @EricPickles @UKHouseofLords @WaffleHouse @mikepiazza31 @MileyCyrus @billyraycyrus Yeah Rosa Parks from the 1913-2005 was VP to Ben Franklin (1705-1790). Makes perfect sense.
49,"@UTDTrey Yes we are going to forget.... Messi was shitted on, mocked and nobody cared for what he achieved when he had no International trophy now y'all feeling somehow... Ronaldo can never and will never be the GOAT until he wins a WC which is impossible 😂 https://t.co/n2bhVGtu3v"
